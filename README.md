Get Stuff Done
==============

My First To-Do list app.

### Current Features

- Add and delete list items.
- Check an item as done to move it to a done list.
- Change your mind and uncheck a done item to move it back to the main list.
- Simply start typing in a new list item to automatically add a new list item below it.

### My Outstanding Feature Wish List

- Ability to grab list items and rearrange them.
- Ability to save a list and come back to it later.
- Ability to have more than one list. eg. A shopping list and a work list.
- Ability to switch between unordered lists and ordered lists.
